		<h4 class="paragraph">Our Company, STEM Foods, is dedicated to helping people live a happy and healthy life, and it also specializes in donating to charity funds to help decrease the global starvation rate. We can see that food shortages are getting even more common due to lack of natural resources and the global population rise. It is a huge problem that can't be ignored. In 2-5 years, we will see that our companyâ€™s product is in every store, market, household, charity organizations and around the world. In conclusion, as world starvation gets more common, our company will grow to help those in need.<br>
		STEM Foods will reach its goal by working with local businesses and charity funds to increase the prevalence of Veggie Harvesters in communities, and also to broaden its impact.</h4>
